### Hello there!

- I'm currently working on HTML websites as I finish an HTML course. 
- After I feel comfortable writing HTML code, I will go on to learn CSS in more depth. 
- Once I feel comfortable using both HTML and CSS, I will go on to learn JavaScript. 

- I hope I can become versed in multiple languages some day and become a full stack developer.

- 😃 Fun fact about me: I have lived in five countries and I am 22 years old. I have also moved houses about 13 times throughout my life.
